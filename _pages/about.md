I am a first-year PhD student in Electrical and Computer Engineering at the University of Texas at Austin, working in the Human Signals Lab advised by Prof. [Edison Thomaz](https://users.ece.utexas.edu/~ethomaz/). My research focuses on human-centered computing, wearable devices, and embedded systems. Specifically, I develop wearable sensing systems and machine learning models to characterize human behaviors. Previously, I received my Master's degree from Northwestern University, where I was advised by Prof. [Nabil Alshurafa](https://www.thehabitslab.com/).
